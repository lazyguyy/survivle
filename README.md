# Survivle

Inspired by Josh Wardle's fantastic (and very popular) [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) and qntm's [Absurdle](https://qntm.org/files/absurdle/absurdle.html), I decided to add yet another spin-off to the fast and ever growing world of Wordle derivatives.
The goal in Survivle is, opposite to the original, to take as many guesses as possible before entering the secret word.


"But that is easy", I hear you say, "I can just enter XYLYL until the heat death of the universe occurs". Ha! — if only it was that easy. To foil that plan, the game is played in hardmode, i.e. all revealed information must be used.
So no entering words with letters which are already confirmed to not be a part of the secret word, etc. (which makes it more restrictive than the hardmode in the original Wordle).

Since it is not easy to keep track of all the information that can be derived by previous guesses, the computer will let you know what is wrong whenever your guess violates some of the the revealed information.

Good luck! Contrary to what you might believe, it is quite difficult to 'fail' Wordle — that is, to take more than six guesses. You can try it [here](https://lazyguyy.github.io/survivle/) and see for yourself.

(My personal record is 9, with some obscene luck) 

# Feedback

If you feel that there is a bug with the forcing-you-to-use-all-information part of Survivle, feel free to open a Issue, detailing your findings with an example.

Additionally, I tried to make the game playable on all platforms and browsers. Since I'm an amateur web developer with access to only a very select few browser and system configurations, there might be visual bugs all over the place.
If you notice them, I'd also kindly implore you to report them to me (I might try and fix them, but no guarantees!). 

On a similar notice, if you are a more experienced web developer who gets physically ill simply by looking at my code and all the violated best practices, please let me know. This was hacked together from multiple (partly contradicting) stackoverflow posts.
