        Inspired by Josh Wardle's fantastic <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/">Wordle</a> and qntm's very cool adversarial version <a href="https://qntm.org/files/absurdle/absurdle.html">Absurdle</a>, in Survivle it is your goal to <b>lose</b>!<br><br>

        The game plays just like the original in (an even stricter) hardmode: <b>All</b> revealed information has to be used. However, the goal now is to take as many <b>wrong</b> guesses as possible.<br><br>

        Since it is very easy to lose track of the revealed information, the game will let you know what exactly (if anything) is wrong with your current guess. <br><br>

        Good Luck!<br><br>
